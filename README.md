#Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes audio data to identify emotions expressed in speech, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

Features
Emotion detection from speech audio files.
Supports multiple emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
Preprocessing of audio signals for feature extraction.
Machine learning models trained on extracted features for classification.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Audio Processing: librosa, wave
Feature Extraction: numpy, pandas
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras
Dataset: RAVDESS, CREMA-D, or any other public dataset.

System Workflow

Audio Preprocessing:
Convert audio to a consistent format (e.g., mono, specific sample rate).
Normalize and trim silence or noise.

Feature Extraction:
Extract features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, spectral contrast, etc., using librosa.

Model Training:
Train machine learning classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).

Evaluation:
Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Prediction:
Deploy the trained model to predict emotions from new speech inputs.

# Project Title

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Using Machine Learning


## Features

- Emotion detection from speech audio files.
- Supports multiple emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
- Preprocessing of audio signals for feature extraction.
- Machine learning models trained on extracted features for classification.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
- Audio Processing: librosa, wave
- Feature Extraction: numpy, pandas
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras
- Dataset: RAVDESS, CREMA-D, or any other public dataset.
## System Workflow

1. Audio Preprocessing:

- Convert audio to a consistent format (e.g., mono, specific sample rate).
- Normalize and trim silence or noise.
2. Feature Extraction:

- Extract features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, spectral contrast, etc., using librosa.
3. Model Training:

- Train machine learning classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs).
4. Evaluation:

- Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
5. Prediction:

Deploy the trained model to predict emotions from new speech inputs.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Naveen4A1l/Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Project/upload/main
cd speech-emotion-recognition

2. Install dependencies:
